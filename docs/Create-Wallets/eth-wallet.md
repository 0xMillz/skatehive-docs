## ShapeShift Wallet (MultiChain)

Shapeshift is a multichain wallet, you can import your private keys created in step 1) to transform your ETH wallet in a multichain wallet under those same keys


## Dawn Wallet [Best for IOS (safari browser extension)]

Dawn is an iPhone based Ethereum mobile wallet. 

You download the app onto your iPhone and run through the onboarding to get it setup. It has a native Safari extension, which makes it very easy to use Gnars from your iPhones Safari web browser. 

Download here: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dawn-ethereum-wallet/id1673143782

To use, you would go to the Gnars dapp (`gnars.wtf`) on Safari, and then when you click "Connect", "Settle Transaction" etc. a popup will appear which allows you to connect your wallet and interact with Gnars.

A demo of how to use Dawn is here: ![Gnars Demo](https://youtube.com/shorts/GFpCSmBmxx0)

If Dawn isn't supported on your platform (you're not using an iPhone), then MetaMask is the way to go:
